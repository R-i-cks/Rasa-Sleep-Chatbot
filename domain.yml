  utter_iamabot:
  - text: I am a bot, powered by Rasa. In case you are wondering I can help find more about why sleep is important, and some health issues you may run into if you either don´t get enough or quality sleep.
  utter_response_1:
  - text: Great question! As an adult you should sleep for about 7 to 8 hours per night, if you sleep any less than that for an extended period of time be aware you are putting your health at peril.
  utter_response_2:
  - text: Sleep is actually a bit complex. Through a night sleep you go through 4 to 6 sleep cycles, which can be divided in light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep, this last one being the one you get to experience vivid dreaming. Check my sources if you wanna know more!
  utter_response_3:
  - text: The consequences of not getting enough sleep can range from mental to physical. From a mental standpoint it will be increasingly difficult to pay attention, making decisions, dealing with emotions, right until depression, suicide and risk-taking behaviour. Lack of sleep can also lead you to microsleep. This also afects your driving skills, as much or more than alcohol, and can make you prone to make more mistakes in your line of work.
  utter_response_4:
  - text: There are a couple tips I can give you, like going to bed and waking up at establish hours; Exercising, though not close to bedtime; Avoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol; Trying to relax before going to bed; Avoiding screen time before going to bed; Taking your mind off falling asleep, as anxiety can contribute to insomnia, by reading a book for example.
  utter_sleep_facts:
  - text: Did you know that your brain actually heals you when you are asleep? It does so by removing toxins that were produced during the day, pretty much like a kidney does. How fascinating is that?
  - text: Many people 'sleep' on their sleep needs due to thinking they don't need as much! Not getting enough though will make you prone to various health problems, as heart disease and stroke, to demetia and obesity. Sleep is pretty much the elixir of life.
